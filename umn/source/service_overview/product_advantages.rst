Product Advantages
==================

Available Out-of-the-Box
------------------------

You can quickly create APIs by configuring the required settings on the API Gateway console. API Gateway provides an inline debugging tool to simplify API development, and allows you to publish an API in multiple environments for easy testing and fast iteration.

Convenient API Lifecycle Management
-----------------------------------

API Gateway provides full-lifecycle API management, including design, development, test, publish, and O&M, to help you quickly build, manage, and deploy APIs at any scale.

Refined Request Throttling
--------------------------

API Gateway combines synchronous and asynchronous traffic control and multiple algorithms to throttle requests at the second level. You can flexibly define request throttling policies to ensure stability and continuity of API services.

Visualized API Monitoring
-------------------------

API Gateway monitors the number of API calls, data latency, and number of errors, helping you identify potential service risks.

Comprehensive Security Protection
---------------------------------

API Gateway provides multiple measures to secure API calling, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) transfer, strict access control, IP address blacklist/whitelist, authentication, anti-replay, anti-attack, and multiple audit rules. In addition, API Gateway implements flexible and refined quota management and request throttling to help you flexibly and securely open your backend services.

Flexible Policy Routes
----------------------

You can configure backends for an API to forward requests according to multiple policies. This facilitates dark launch and environment management.

SDKs of Different Programming Languages
---------------------------------------

SDKs of different programming languages (such as Java, Go, Python, and C) are available for access from clients. Because the backends do not need to be modified, only one system is required to adapt to different service scenarios (such as mobile devices and IoT).
