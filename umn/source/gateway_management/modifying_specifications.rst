Modifying Specifications
========================

If the specifications of a gateway cannot meet your service requirements, upgrade the specifications.

.. important::

   -  During the specification change, the persistent connection is intermittently disconnected and needs to be re-established. You are advised to change the specification during off-peak hours.
   -  Specifications can be upgraded but cannot be downgraded.
   -  Changing the gateway edition will also change the private network access IP addresses. Modify your firewall or whitelist configuration if necessary for service continuity. Do not perform any other operations on the gateway.

Procedure
---------

#. Go to the APIG console.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **Gateways**.

3. Choose **More** > **Modify Specifications** on the right of the target gateway.
4. Select an edition and click **Next**. For details about the gateway parameters, see :ref:`Table 1 <apig_03_0039__en-us_topic_0000001222396877_en-us_topic_0272531149_table535412092617>`.
5. Confirm the configuration, read and confirm your acceptance of the service agreement, and click **Pay Now**. The upgrade takes 15 to 30 minutes to complete.

   .. note::

      -  For pay-per-use gateways, pay for what you use without needing to pay for any extra fees.
