Resetting the AppSecret of an App
=================================

Scenario
--------

You can reset the AppSecret of an app. The AppKey is unique and cannot be reset. When you reset the AppSecret, it becomes invalid and APIs bound to the app cannot be called. To enable API calls for that app again, you will need to update the AppSecret of the app you use.

Prerequisites
-------------

You have created an app.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **Dedicated Gateways**. Then click **Access Console** in the upper right corner of a dedicated gateway.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **API Calling** > **Apps**.
#. Click the name of the target app.
#. In the upper right corner of the displayed app details page, click **Reset AppSecret**.
#. Click **Yes**.
