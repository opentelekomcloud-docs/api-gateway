Introduction
============

API Gateway (APIG) is a fully managed service that enables you to securely build, manage, and deploy APIs at any scale with high performance and availability. With APIG, you can easily integrate your internal service systems and selectively expose your service capabilities.

To learn about the process of exposing and calling an API, see :ref:`Opening APIs <apig-en-ug-180307001>` and :ref:`Calling APIs <apig-en-ug-180307007>`. **Simple authentication** with an app is used for illustration.
