How Can I Use APIG?
===================

You can use APIG to manage and call APIs in the following ways:

-  Management console, a web-based service management platform

   If you have already registered an account, log in to the management console, click |image1| in the upper left corner, and choose **APIG**.

   For details about the functions and operations of the APIG console, see the *User Guide*.

-  Java, Go, Python, JavaScript, C#, PHP, C++, C, and Android SDKs

   Download an SDK and use it to call APIs. For details, see the *Developer Guide*.
