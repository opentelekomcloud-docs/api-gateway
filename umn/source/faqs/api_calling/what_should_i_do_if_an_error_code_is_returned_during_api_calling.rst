What Should I Do If an Error Code Is Returned During API Calling?
=================================================================

If an error code is returned when you call your own APIs, see :ref:`Error Codes <apig_03_0048>`.

If an error code is returned when you manage your APIs,see section "Error Codes" in the *API Gateway API Reference*.
