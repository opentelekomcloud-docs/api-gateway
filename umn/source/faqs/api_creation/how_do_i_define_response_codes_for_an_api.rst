How Do I Define Response Codes for an API?
==========================================

There are two types of responses:

-  Gateway response codes: returned by the gateway for API requests that are throttled, denied, or failed in authentication. For details about these response codes, see section "Creating a Gateway Response" in the *API Gateway User Guide*.
-  Backend service responses: defined by backend API services (API providers) and transparently transmitted by APIG.
