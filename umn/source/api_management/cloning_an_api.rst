Cloning an API
==============

To improve API creation efficiency, you can clone an API with a custom name and path.

Policies bound to an API cannot be cloned and can only be manually bound to the new API.

Prerequisites
-------------

You have created an API. If no API is available, create one by referring to :ref:`Creating an API <apig_03_0010>`.

Procedure
---------

#. Go to the APIG console.
#. Select a dedicated gateway at the top of the navigation pane.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **API Management** > **API Groups**.
4. Click a group name.
5. On the **APIs** tab, choose **More** > **Clone**.
6. Set the API name and path, and click **OK**.

Follow-Up Operations
--------------------

After cloning an API, verify it by following the procedure in :ref:`Debugging an API <apig_03_0012>`.
