Overview
========

API Gateway (APIG) is a high-performance, high-availability, and high-security API hosting service that helps enterprises build, manage, and deploy APIs at any scale.

This document describes how to use REST APIs to perform operations on APIG, such as creating, deleting, and modify your own APIs.

If you plan to access APIG through APIs, ensure that you are familiar with APIG concepts. For details, see the *API Gateway User Guide*.
